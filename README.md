This map of various flowering trees in NYC was made for my web mapping class at NYU Wagner.

Spring is my favorite season in NYC and I love seeing all the beautiful vibrantly colored plants emerge and enliven the city. This map draws attention to three popular species of flowering plants that have been planted throughout NYC streets: Crabapple trees, Magnolia trees, and Eastern Redbud trees. My hope is that users will use the map as a tool for exploring blossoming trees on their walks throughout New York City.
